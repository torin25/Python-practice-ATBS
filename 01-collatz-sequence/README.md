# Collatz Sequence

A simple Python script that generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer.

## How It Works

- Takes a natural number as input.
- If the number is even → divides it by 2.
- If the number is odd → multiplies by 3 and adds 1.
- Repeats the process until the number becomes 1.

## Example

```
Enter the number: 6
Input: 6
3
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
```

## File

- `collatz.py` — contains the logic and input validation.

## Note

This is a practice task from the book  
**"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.**
